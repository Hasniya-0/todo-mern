⚙️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
    Node.js (v18 or higher) – Download
    Git – Download
    MongoDB running locally or via MongoDB Atlas


## Installation

Clone the repository
       git clone https://github.com/username/todo-mern.git
       cd todo-mern


## Install dependencies
    *Install backend dependencies
       npm install

## Navigate to frontend folder (if separate)
     cd client
     npm install


##Running the Application Locally

You need to run backend and frontend in separate terminals:

1️⃣ Start the backend server
# From project root
    npm start

              /* Backend runs on http://localhost:5000

              MongoDB must be running  

              Terminal output:

              🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
              ✅ MongoDB Connected   */

2️⃣ Start the frontend React app
# From project root
    npm run client



 ##  Optional: Run Both Together
     npm install -g concurrently
     concurrently "npm start" "npm run client"

## 🚀 Deployment Process
      Developers push feature branches → develop
      Pull Requests created and reviewed
      Approved PRs merged into develop
      DevOps Engineer merges develop → main
      GitHub Actions automatically:
      Installs dependencies
      Runs build

Lints code
    Deploys to Vercel


⚠️ Merge Conflict Documentation
              Conflict occurred in App.jsx between feature/progress-bar and feature/add-task-ui
              Resolved manually by editing conflicting lines
              Commit message: fix: resolve merge conflict in App component

🧩 Challenges Faced
          React state management for tasks
          CI/CD YAML syntax issues
          Backend/frontend connection setup
          Resolving merge conflicts

## 📊 Collaboration Evidence

* Multiple feature branches created
* Minimum 3 meaningful commits from all members
* Pull Requests created and reviewed
* Merge conflict resolved and documented
* CI/CD workflows running successfully

Progress bar showing completion percentage

Fully containerized backend, frontend, and MongoDB

Accessible through browser and API

**Prerequisites**

Docker Desktop
 installed

Optional: Node.js
 and npm (for local development)


 **Project Structure**
src/
 ├─ client/                 # React frontend
 │   ├─ App.js
 │   ├─ api.js
 │   ├─ App.css
 │   └─ Dockerfile
 ├─ server/                 # Node.js backend
 │   ├─ server.js
 │   ├─ config/db.js
 │   ├─ routes/todoRoutes.js
 │   ├─ models/todoModel.js
 │   └─ Dockerfile
 └─ docker-compose.yml


** Docker Setup**

Open terminal in project root and build/run containers:

    docker-compose up --build


 **this will create and run three containers:**

Service	Port Mapping
client	3000 → 80
server	5000 → 5000
mongo	27017 → 27017


**Verify containers are running:**

    docker ps


**Backend API**

Backend is available at http://localhost:5000/api/todos.

GET / → List all todos

POST / → Add new todo ({"text":"your todo"})

PUT /:id → Toggle todo completion

DELETE /:id → Delete todo

Example using PowerShell / curl:

# Get all todos
    curl http://localhost:5000/api/todos

# Add new todo
    curl -Method POST -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/todos -Body '{"text":"new todo"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Toggle todo completion
    curl -Method PUT http://localhost:5000/api/todos/<todo_id>

# Delete todo
    curl -Method DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/todos/<todo_id>



**Frontend**

Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000.

Input box to add a new todo

Click on todo text to toggle completed status

Click 🗑 button to delete a todo

Shows percentage of completed todos in a progress bar




**Environment Variables**

Configured in docker-compose.yml:

environment:
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/tododb

Backend connects to MongoDB container using this URI
